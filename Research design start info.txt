1. Reverse Engineering, how it is done questions: For the needs of this paper we are going to conduct an applied research. The first thing is to understand how is firmware being reverse engineered? What tools an techniques are used? How does those tools work, what algorithms they execute? Also the result is very important, what holes are found? How dangerous are those they? Can those holes be used to illegally access other parts of an software eco-system?

2. Simple ways to enhance firmware security (if any):
Are there any software solutions to patch known vulnerabilities?
Are there any hardware solutions to patch known vulnerabilities?
How to implement those solutions?
Any other ways for improving security?

3. Applied solutions result check:
1. Do the applied software solution work?
1.1. Did they create any other issues?
2. Did the applied hardware solutions work?
2.1. Did they create any other issues?
3. Overall solution check.
3.1 How much harder is now to penetrate firmware's code?
3.2 Did the number of reverse engineered/penetrated devices decrease?
3.3 Do the proposed solutions worth the effort for the achieved result?


What is Reseach design?
RD is the general plan of how you will answer your research questions.
Part 1 of Reseach Design.
The plan should state clearly the following issues:
	Purpose of the study.
	The strategies.
	The time time dimensions.
	The research environment.
	Unit of analysis.
	Sampling design*.
	Data collection method*.
	Measurement*.
	Data Analysis*.
Part 2 => Methodology
Non-empirical research approach
Qualitative research
