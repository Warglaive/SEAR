\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Research Design}
The conducted research is about firmware security mainly but we will touch on the topic of embedded devices also because the two work together. In general, most devices with firmware are relatively easy to reverse engineer by hackers who want to find vulnerabilities that they can exploit to attack different parts of the eco-system. Therefore the goal of this research is to find a way to increase firmware security.
\subsection{Purpose of the study} 
The goal of the study is to find out how exactly is firmware being reverse engineered in order to find new protection methods against reverse engineering.


\section{Methods of data collection and analysis}

\subsection{Strategies}
The strategy of how this research must be conducted is to seek answers to the questions mentioned in "Purpose of the study" subsection. The questions shall be answered by reading previous researches on very close to this subjects.
We will try to collect material proving that there are ways to improve security in firmware and to restrict or block reverse engineering of embedded devices. That evidence should not have been determined previously in order to be valid for this research.
\subsection{Hypothesis}
Providing even a minor solution regarding increase security for reverse engineering of embedded devices and their firmware, may result in rapid decrease in exploits of embedded devices therefore companies shall spend less on security and more on functionality.
