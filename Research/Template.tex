In recent years embedded devices have become very popular in many countries worldwide, they are often used in households, factories, and even in infrastructure objects. Their usage is predicted to increase steadily in the next decades. Our focus is that all embedded devices run on Firmware, which is basically computer software that is meant to work with specific hardware. The Firmware is not as secure as we would like it to be, there are many ways of hacking (reverse engineering) it so that one (the hacker) can find how exactly it operates and if there are any holes that can be exploited for benefit or used to harm either the users or the creators of the firmware.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide the reader with everything they need to know to understand what you are doing and why

	\item Length: max 3 pages
	\item Theoretical background (literature review)
	\item Why the work is important
	\item Specific research question
	\item (if applicable) Hypothesis to be tested
	\item Divide into subsections
\end{itemize}

The research we are conducting is about firmware security mainly but we will touch on the topic of embedded devices also because the two work together. In general, most devices with firmware are relatively easy to reverse engineer by hackers who want to find vulnerabilities that they can exploit to attack different parts of the eco-system. Therefore the goal of this research is to find a way to increase firmware security.

\section{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How you performed the experiment / interview / survey or how you set up your comparative analysis
	\item Length: min. 2 pages
	\item Methodology (Research strategy, material, planning): which method you used, why, how it was carried out
	\item NO results or interpretation in this section!
\end{itemize}

We should primarily focus on experiments and research papers as material. Because these two sources give us a deep understanding of the underlying structure and the causes of the problem. Every paper you read should be logged on one of the following pages. To prove our research we maybe provide interviews.

\section{Results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Share the data you found
	\item Length: min. 2 pages
	\item Describe the results (do NOT add your interpretation/analysis)
	\item Graphs, figures and tables that show your data belong in this section. Describe the graphs and explain what the reader is seeing

\end{itemize}

	
\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Interpret the results from the previous section
	\item Answer your research question/s and explain if your hypothesis was proven right or not: Refer to starting point (objective research question)

	\item Length: max. 4 pages
	\item Evaluate process (Reflection: how did it go)
	\item Further research (how your research could be improved, what else could be done)
\end{itemize}
