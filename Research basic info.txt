Research area: Firmware Security
Problem: 
for firmware reverse engineering there are many tools and instructions available. 
For example you can download the firmware of an router and reverse engineer it to see the actual code.

Attackers reverse engineer firmware so they can find vulnarabilities, things that they can exploit to attack other elements of the eco system.
Backdoor vulnarability as an example.

Research question:
How to secure firmware against reverse engineering?

Overall objective:
Make reverse engineering of Firmware harder.


Research question possible answers:
obfuscation
external key for firmware 
firmware running on virtual machine 

TIPS:
1. Write simple ( ur little bro should understand ).
2. Don't go into details (if details - explain them simple).

Completed TODOs:
1. What type of research is the objective - Applied research
2. What are the important elements/objects?
	Firmware, Reverse Engineering(hacking of firmware), embedded devices.

Research Design TODOs:	
3. How is Firmware being reverse engineered?
4. How to block/patch/ some reverse engineering techniques?
