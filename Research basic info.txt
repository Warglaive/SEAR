Research area: Firmware Security
Problem: 
for firmware reverse engineering there are many tools and instructions available. 
For example you can download the firmware of an router and reverse engineer it to see the actual code.

Attackers reverse engineer firmware so they can find vulnarabilities, things that they can exploit to attack other elements of the eco system.
Backdoor vulnarability as an example.

Research question:
How to secure firmware against reverse engineering?

Overall objective:
Make reverse engineering of Firmware harder.


Research question possible answers:
obfuscation
external key for firmware 
firmware running on virtual machine 

TIPS:
1. Write simple ( ur little bro should understand ).
2. Don't go into details (if details - explain them simple).

Completed TODOs:
1. What type of research is the objective - Applied research
2. What are the important elements/objects?
	Firmware, Reverse Engineering(hacking of firmware), embedded devices.

Research Design TODOs:	
3. How is Firmware being reverse engineered?
4. How to block/patch/ some reverse engineering techniques?

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The first thing is to understand how is firmware being reverse engineered? 
 	\begin{itemize}
 	\item What tools an techniques are used? 
 	\item How does those tools work, what algorithms they execute? 
 	\item Also the result is very important, what holes are found? 
 	\item How dangerous are those they? 
 	\item Can those holes be used to help access other parts of an software eco-system?
 	\end{itemize}

	\item Simple ways to enhance firmware security (if any):
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Are there any software solutions to patch known vulnerabilities?
	\item Are there any hardware solutions to patch known vulnerabilities?
	\item How to implement those solutions?
	\item Any other ways for improving security?
	\end{itemize}

\item Applied solutions result check:
\begin{itemize}
\item Does the applied software solution work?
\item Does it creates any other issues?
\item Does the applied hardware solutions work?
\item Do they create any other issues?
\item How much harder is now to penetrate firmware's code after applying the discovered solutions?
\item Does the number of reverse engineered and penetrated devices decrease after applying the discovered solutions??
\item Does the proposed solutions worth the effort for the achieved result?
\end{itemize}
